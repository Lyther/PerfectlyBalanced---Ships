 LARGE_FISSION_REACTOR:0 "Large Fission Reactor"
 LARGE_FISSION_REACTOR_DESC:0 "Increasing the size of the fission reactor, generating more waste heat, also carries a higher risk that large amounts of nuclear waste will be thrown directly into space - after all, who cares?"
 LARGE_FUSION_REACTOR:0 "Large Fusion Reactor"
 LARGE_FUSION_REACTOR_DESC:0 "The risk of higher reaction temperatures and martyrdom is assumed, but the energy yield of the fusion reaction is greatly enhanced."
 LARGE_COLD_FUSION_REACTOR:0 "Large Cold Fusion Reactor"
 LARGE_COLD_FUSION_REACTOR_DESC:0 "Part of the hull space was dismantled and replaced with a larger scale cold fusion reactor."
 LARGE_ANTIMATTER_REACTOR:0 "Large Antimatter Reactor"
 LARGE_ANTIMATTER_REACTOR_DESC:0 "Extremely efficient matter annihilation reactions, annihilating part of the hull from time to time, but for more energy, that's acceptable, isn't it?"
 LARGE_ZERO_POINT_REACTOR:0 "Large Zero Point Reactor"
 LARGE_ZERO_POINT_REACTOR_DESC:0 "The vacuum zero-point can be so cheap and unending source, of course, to fill the cabin with zero point reactor."
 LARGE_DARK_MATTER_REACTOR:0 "Large Dark Matter Reactor"
 LARGE_DARK_MATTER_REACTOR_DESC:0 "Truly infinite."

 SUPER_FISSION_REACTOR:0 "Super Fission Reactor"
 SUPER_FISSION_REACTOR_DESC:0 "Almost the entire ship's hold is piled high with fission reactor power and its feedstock, the only cost being that our crew occasionally grows extra limbs and heads."
 SUPER_FUSION_REACTOR:0 "Super fusion reactor"
 SUPER_FUSION_REACTOR_DESC:0 "The giant fusion reactor is constantly emitting blazing energy, but the good news is we'll be dropping crew members with heatstroke into space to be treated."
 SUPER_COLD_FUSION_REACTOR:0 "Super cold fusion reactor"
 SUPER_COLD_FUSION_REACTOR_DESC:0 "Cold fusion solves a host of thorny problems so we can replace more parts of the ship with reactor components, such as the rudder, bulkheads, crew bunks, etc."
 SUPER_ANTIMATTER_REACTOR:0 "Super Antimatter Reactor"
 SUPER_ANTIMATTER_REACTOR_DESC:0 "Annihilation of positive and antimatter is an extremely efficient way to generate electricity, so we will keep the number of positive matter crew members balanced with the number of antimatter crew members in order to achieve the highest power generation efficiency."
 SUPER_ZERO_POINT_REACTOR:0 "Super Zero Reactor"
 SUPER_ZERO_POINT_REACTOR_DESC:0 "It is said that vacuum zero can have the risk of causing vacuum decay, but who cares, after all, where am I going to make up for the missing energy piece?"
 SUPER_DARK_MATTER_REACTOR:0 "Super dark matter reactor"
 SUPER_DARK_MATTER_REACTOR_DESC:0 "Incomprehensible pioneer energy."
